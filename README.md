# Diction browser extension for Chrome

Once the extension is installed and the user approves the required permissions for recording media from his device, the extension should work in the following way:

1. When visiting a page with Macedonian print, the user gets prompted once every couple of hours.
2. The prompt contains an excerpt from a book written in Macedonian, or a phrase searched for on Google Translate.
3. The user clicks on the record button, and speaks the phrase into the microphone. He hits stop recording.
4. If the user is satisfied with their diction, they click on a confirm button. If not, they can choose to either re-record or cancel.
5. Upon pressing confirm, the audio file is sent to a running server which processes/ re-samples/ stores the audio file.
